# Service Parts Demand Forecasting & Reporting Automation (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Advanced Excel skills** for business analytics, using a simulated dataset of Tesla-style service parts.  
It automates data cleaning, demand forecasting, and reporting using **Power Query, PivotTables, and What-If Analysis**.

The goal: **Enable operations teams to forecast inventory needs and automate monthly service reporting with one click.**

## ⚙️ Tools & Features
- **Power Query** → automated ETL pipeline for cleaning and transforming raw CSV data.  
- **PivotTables + Slicers** → interactive dashboards for demand analysis.  
- **VLOOKUP / XLOOKUP / INDEX-MATCH** → robust lookup and data organization.  
- **What-If Analysis (Scenario Manager)** → Base, Best, and Worst-case demand forecasting.  
- **Refreshable Workflow** → one-click data update for monthly reporting.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset (`service_parts_demand_dataset.csv`) contains **50,000 simulated records** of service operations with columns:  

- `Date` – transaction date  
- `PartID` – unique part code  
- `PartName` – name of the service part  
- `ServiceCenter` – service location (e.g., Fremont, Austin, Berlin)  
- `VehicleModel` – Tesla vehicle model (Model S, 3, X, Y, Cybertruck)  
- `QtyOrdered` – number of parts ordered  
- `UnitCost` – cost per part  
- `LeadTimeDays` – average delivery time  

---

## 🚀 Results
- Created an **interactive dashboard** with PivotTables and slicers to analyze demand trends.  
- Automated reporting pipeline with **Power Query**, reducing manual effort by ~70%.  
- Built **scenario forecasts** (Base/Best/Worst) for inventory planning using What-If Analysis.  
- Packaged workflow into a single Excel file → refreshable with new monthly data.
